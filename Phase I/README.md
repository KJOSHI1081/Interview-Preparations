| Phase | Weeks | DSA (2h Weekday / 4h Weekend) | SysDesign (1h Daily) | Behavioral (1h Weekend) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase I** | **1-3** | Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists | **Scalability:** LB, Vertical vs Horizontal, Latency vs Throughput. | **Story Mapping:** Identify 10 key projects from your career. |
| | **4-6** | Sorting, Searching, Math | **Databases:** SQL vs NoSQL, Indexing, ACID vs BASE. | **Leadership:** Define your "Staff" philosophy (e.g., Mentorship). |
| | **7-9** | Recursion & Backtracking | **Caching:** CDN, Redis, Eviction strategies. | **Conflict:** Recall times you disagreed with a PM or Lead. |

### 🎯 Objective
The goal of this phase is to move beyond basic syntax and develop deep intuition for **linear data structures** and **algorithmic efficiency**. 

> **Note:** Pay special attention to the "Prep File Focus" items, as these represent the most common patterns seen in technical interviews and system optimization.
