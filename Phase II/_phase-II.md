# Phase II: Hierarchical Data & Distributed Services

**Duration:** 9 Weeks (Mar 27, 2026 – May 28, 2026)  
**Focus:** Moving from single-machine logic to networked data and non-linear relationships.

### 🎯 Objective
This phase transitions from linear sequences to **hierarchical and networked structures**. You will focus on how data branches and connects, which is the foundation for folder systems, social networks, and routing algorithms.



### 💡 Implementation Tips
* **Visualization is Key:** For Trees and Graphs, always sketch the nodes and edges on paper or a whiteboard before writing code.
* **Recursion Proficiency:** Phase II relies heavily on the recursion skills you built at the end of Phase I.
* **Complexities:** Shift your focus toward understanding $O(\log n)$ for trees and $O(V + E)$ for graph traversals.

> **Pro-Tip:** When working on `graphs_adv.py`, pay close attention to **Union-Find**. It is an incredibly powerful tool for detecting cycles and connecting components in distributed systems.
