### 🎯 Objective
Phase III is designed to refine your ability to handle **complex optimization problems** and **multi-threaded environments**. You will learn to recognize sub-problem overlaps and manage resource contention in modern software.



### 🚀 Advanced Mastery Areas

* **Optimal Substructure:** Moving from brute force to $O(n)$ or $O(n \cdot w)$ solutions using Dynamic Programming.
* **String Matching & Range Queries:** Mastering specialized structures like Segment Trees for lightning-fast data retrieval.
* **System Integrity:** Understanding how the Python Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) and `asyncio` impact performance in high-concurrency applications.



> **Warning:** Dynamic Programming is often the "make or break" topic in senior-level interviews. Focus heavily on the **State Transition Equation**—once you define the relationship between sub-problems, the code usually follows.
