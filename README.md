# Staff Engineer Interview Preparation Roadmap
# Staff Engineer Interview Preparation Roadmap

| Phase | Weeks | DSA (2h Weekday / 4h Weekend) | SysDesign (1h Daily) | Behavioral (1h Weekend) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase I** | **1-3** | Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists | **Scalability:** LB, Vertical vs Horizontal, Latency vs Throughput. | **Story Mapping:** Identify 10 key projects from your career. |
| | **4-6** | Sorting, Searching, Math | **Databases:** SQL vs NoSQL, Indexing, ACID vs BASE. | **Leadership:** Define your "Staff" philosophy (e.g., Mentorship). |
| | **7-9** | Recursion & Backtracking | **Caching:** CDN, Redis, Eviction strategies. | **Conflict:** Recall times you disagreed with a PM or Lead. |
| **Phase II** | **10-12** | Trees & BSTs | **Communication:** gRPC, REST, WebSockets, Thrift. | **Impact:** Quantify your results ($ saved, time reduced). |
| | **13-15** | Heaps & Tries | **Messaging:** Kafka, RabbitMQ, Fan-out patterns. | **Failure:** Prepare a story about a project that failed and why. |
| | **16-18** | Graphs (Deep Dive) | **Storage:** Sharding, Replication, Consistent Hashing. | **Ambiguity:** Times you led with no clear requirements. |
| **Phase III** | **19-21** | Dynamic Programming | **Availability:** Circuit Breakers, Retries, Quorum (Paxos/Raft). | **Mentorship:** How you've grown other Senior engineers. |
| | **22-24** | Famous Algos & Misc | **Observability:** Distributed Tracing, SLIs/SLOs/SLAs. | **Strategy:** Influencing the long-term roadmap. |
| **Phase IV** | **25-27** | **Hard Drills:** Focus on modularity & clean code. | **Full Designs:** Scratch-builds (e.g., Google Drive, Ad Clicker). | **Mocks:** Record yourself for clarity & executive presence. |

## Phase 4 Execution Checklist

### 🧠 DSA: The "Clean Code" Standard
* [ ] Can I explain the time/space complexity before writing a single line?
* [ ] Am I using descriptive variable names and modularizing helper functions?
* [ ] Can I pivot my solution if the interviewer adds a new constraint?

### 🏗️ System Design: The Architect's View
* [ ] **Back-of-the-envelope:** Can I estimate RPS, storage, and bandwidth in < 2 minutes?
* [ ] **Deep Dives:** Can I explain the "Why" behind a specific database choice?
* [ ] **Bottlenecks:** Did I identify the single point of failure in my design?

### 🗣️ Behavioral: Executive Presence
* [ ] **The "So What?":** Does every story end with a clear business or technical impact?
* [ ] **Clarity:** Am I avoiding rambling? (Use the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result).
* [ ] **Signal:** Am I showing "Staff" signals like cross-functional influence and mentorship?
